Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Policy
Vision
At DataColada
, our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is at the heart of who we are and what we do. As a top-tier Salesforce Summit partner, we recognize that our strength lies in our people. We believe in creating a workplace where every individual feels valued, empowered, and inspired to bring their whole selves to work every day.
Our Guiding Light
Our guiding light for DEI is to build a culture where differences are celebrated, voices are heard, and opportunities are accessible to all. We strive to create an environment where everyone, regardless of their background, identity, or experiences, can thrive and contribute to our collective success.
Commitment to Action
1.
Inclusive Hiring Practices
We are proud participants in the Salesforce Talent Alliance program, with seven talented individuals already on board. We are dedicated to expanding this initiative, bringing more diverse candidates into the Salesforce ecosystem, and ensuring our hiring processes are inclusive and equitable.
2.
Employee Empowerment
At DataColada, we foster a culture of continuous learning and development. We provide our team members with resources, mentorship, and growth opportunities to help them reach their full potential. Every employee is encouraged to share their unique perspectives and ideas, driving innovation and excellence in our work.
3.
Safe and Supportive Environment
We are committed to maintaining a safe and supportive environment where every employee feels respected and valued. Our policies and practices are designed to promote fairness, prevent discrimination, and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to succeed.
4.
Ongoing Education and Awareness
We believe in the power of education to drive change. DataColada offers regular DEI training and workshops to all employees, helping to build awareness, empathy, and understanding across our organisation. We are dedicated to fostering a culture of continuous improvement and learning.
5.
Community Engagement
Our commitment to DEI extends beyond our organization. We actively engage with diverse communities, support initiatives that promote equity, and partner with organizations that share our values. By doing so, we aim to contribute to a more inclusive and equitable world.
Thought Leadership in DEI
We see ourselves as thought leaders in the Salesforce ecosystem; with this view, DataColada is dedicated to setting the standard for DEI. We draw inspiration from high-performing businesses that have successfully integrated DEI into their practices, such as Salesforce and Google and from our customers like Australian Disability Network and Good Things Foundation.
These organisations have demonstrated that prioritising DEI not only fosters a more inclusive culture but also drives innovation, enhances employee engagement, and improves business performance.
At DataColada, we share our experiences, learnings, and best practices with our partners, clients, and the broader community. Our goal is to inspire others to join us on this journey, creating a ripple effect of positive change across the industry.
Definitions of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
Diversity
refers to the presence of differences within a given setting. This can include race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status, language, (dis)ability, age, religious commitment, or political perspective. According to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), diversity encompasses the full spectrum of human differences, including the various characteristics, perspectives, and experiences people bring to the workplace.
Equity
is the process of ensuring that processes and programs are impartial, fair, and provide equal possible outcomes for every individual. The World Economic Forum defines equity as providing the resources and opportunities needed for all individuals to reach an equal outcome, recognizing that different people have different needs and starting points.
Inclusion
is the practice of creating environments in which any individual or group can feel welcomed, respected, supported, and valued. It’s about fostering a culture that values and celebrates individual and group differences within a workplace. According to Harvard Business Review, inclusion is about removing barriers to ensure that all individuals feel valued and can contribute fully to the organization.
Our Commitment to DEI
We are committed to creating and maintaining a work environment that is free from discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, or any other protected characteristic.
We are committed to providing equal opportunities for all employees, and we will not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment in the workplace.
Additionally, we are committed to promoting diversity and inclusion at all levels of the company. This includes recruiting, hiring, and promoting employees from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences, as well as providing training and support to help all employees feel valued and respected.
We believe that fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace is essential for our success, and we are committed to supporting our employees in this effort. We encourage all employees to join us in creating a work environment that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals.
Call to Action
We invite every member of the DataColada family to embrace our DEI vision and actively contribute to our mission. Together, we can create a workplace where diversity is celebrated, equity is pursued, and inclusion is a lived reality for all.
At DataColada, we believe that our differences are our greatest strengths. Let’s continue to build a future where everyone feels valued, heard, and empowered to achieve their best.
Join us in making DataColada a beacon of diversity, equity, and inclusion.
